In this folder, I have included all the pratice problems that I provided in my book. 

I have also given you the instructions at the top of each .py file, 
and if you scroll lower, I included a solution to each problem at the bottom of each file. 

The solution is inside docstrings so that it does not interfere when you are trying to run the code that you wrote. 

However, if you want to run the solution, simply 
just remove the docstrings that it is embedded in.
